# Readme

This repository contains R code for plotting temperature data and survival curves from different animal groups. The example dataset consists of daily temperature and survival data of two groups of animals. You can add more groups to the data set as long as you do not destory the name of the columns. <b>In this example, the data were randomly generated. </b> 

## 1. Daily Mean Temperature of Groups (with Standard Error in Mean)
